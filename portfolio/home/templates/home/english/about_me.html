                  I am passionate about Programming, Analytics, Data Science and Machine Learning
                  with a strong focus on developing analytical skills and problem solving.
                  With a background in Software Development, my curiosity and desire to learn led me to acquire solid
                  knowledge about Programming in different languages.
              </li>
              <li>
                  I started out in 2003 with Microsoft Visual Basic 6, Microsoft FoxPro, Microsoft Visual FoxPro,
                  then Microsoft Visual Basic.net, Microsoft Visual C#, SQL, HTML, Javascript, AJAX, Microsoft SQL Server,
                  implementing different solutions to the requirements of the Company I was developing for. These
                  focused primarily on various independent desktop applications in which data had to be loaded
                  and retrieved manually for later use; until arriving at the planning and
                  deployment of a custom ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) according to the
                  requirements of the different Sectors of the same.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Later, I decided to leave behind proprietary platforms and start working on Open Source platforms
                  so, looking for other programming languages â€‹and through my colleagues I got to know Python, which thanks to 
                  its simplicity and clarity of code made me fall in love with it and focus on it, both in the development of 
                  Desktop Applications and Web Applications; later moving on to Data Analysis and Science and through it, 
                  implementing solutions in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, disciplines that have captivated me, where I 
                  work with Pandas and NumPy to TensorFlow and Pytorch.
              </li>
              <li>
                  I have consolidated my experience developing various projects ranging from a simple calculator, exploratory 
                  data analysis (EDA) to the implementation of advanced machines with various learning models.
              </li>
              <li>
                  My approach to problem solving has been reflected in practical projects where I have applied Machine Learning 
                  techniques to make informed decisions and improve decision-making processes.
